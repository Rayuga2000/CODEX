        <font face="Comic Sans MS" color="white">Toshinori Yagi, more commonly known by his hero name, All Might, is the tritagonist of My Hero Academia. All Might is the former No. 1 Pro Hero who bore the title of the world's Symbol of Peace. He teaches Foundational Hero Studies at U.A. High School.<br><br>

        All Might was the eighth holder of the One For All Quirk after receiving it from Nana Shimura. He has since passed the torch to Izuku Midoriya, whom he is grooming to be his successor. After using up all the embers of One For All to defeat All For One, All Might retired and ended his era as the world's greatest hero.</font><br><br>

        <font face="Comic Sans MS" color="white">Toshinori Yagi, more commonly known by his hero name, All Might, is the tritagonist of My Hero Academia. All Might is the former No. 1 Pro Hero who bore the title of the world's Symbol of Peace. He teaches Foundational Hero Studies at U.A. High School.<br><br>
        
        All Might was recognized as the strongest hero in the world. He was the "Symbol of Peace" and such a deterrent against crime that villains were largely discouraged by his presence in society. He was able to defeat All For One, a dangerous supervillain who once ruled all of Japan ages ago, and is revered as Japan‚Äôs most powerful villain, twice; he was the only user of One For All who was able to win against him. Despite winning, All Might suffered a gruesome injury at the hands of All For One that limited his maximum power output going forward.
