	<h1>💀All Might💀</h1>
	<p>
		Toshinori Yagi (八や木ぎ俊とし典のり Yagi Toshinori?), more commonly known by his hero name, All Might (オールマイト Ōru Maito?), is the tritagonist of My Hero Academia. All Might is the former No. 1 Pro Hero who bore the title of the world's Symbol of Peace (平和の象徴 Heiwa no Shōchō?). He teaches Foundational Hero Studies at U.A. High School.

		All Might was the eighth holder of the One For All Quirk after receiving it from Nana Shimura. He has since passed the torch to Izuku Midoriya, whom he is training to be his successor. After using up all the embers of One For All to defeat All For One, All Might retired and ended his era as the world's greatest hero.
	</p>
		In his empowered form, Toshinori is a very large man with an equally-muscular and well-defined physique, his design resembling a typical western comic book superhero. He has short blond hair, swept backwards, with two distinct tufts that stick up above his head, leaning slightly to each side, which often casts a dark shadow over his face, hiding everything but his bright blue eyes.
